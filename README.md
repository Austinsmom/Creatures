# Creatures

Creatures is a small evolution simulator. It's about creatures trying to survive and procreate.
Each new creature inherits the properties of it's parents, combined with mutations. This leads to gradual changes in the distribution of certain attributes. These changes can be graphically seen in a statistics module.

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). The gradle wrapper is also included, so gradle doesn't need to be installed manually.
Run ```gradlew build``` to build the project and ```gradlew run``` to execute it.

For more information take a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/thopit/Creatures/wiki).
